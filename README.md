Maze Fighter is a fun little action mobile game we made using Unity. <br>
The game has 5 levels, each with different design. <br>
In every level the objective is to capture a flag and escape the level using a portal. <br>
To make it interesting we implemented AI agents that play against you. <br>
AI agents control similar characters to yours. They use an A* pathfinding algorithm to move around. It's possible to customize their difficulty in the game. Depending on the chosen difficulty. Depending on the chosen difficulty, the agents will have different:
  - Sight radius
  - Shooting accuracy
  - Shooting cooldown interval
